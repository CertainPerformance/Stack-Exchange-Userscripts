# Stack Exchange Userscripts

This is a collection of userscripts for Stack Exchange sites by [CertainPerformance](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9515207/certainperformance).

Sites often have bugs, a less-than-stellar UI, and fewer features than one would like. Stack Exchange is no exception. Userscripts can fix all of this, and significantly improve your browsing experience. Saved clicks, UI tweaks, and automatic data processing can make your life much easier.

Scripts are intended to be compatible with browsers which support ES2017 (Chrome 55+, FF 52+).

Feel free to [report issues](https://github.com/CertainPerformance/Stack-Exchange-Userscripts/issues).
