# Snippet Modal Fixer (&#8202;[install](https://github.com/CertainPerformance/Stack-Exchange-Userscripts/raw/master/Stack-Snippet-Userscripts/Modal-Fixer/StackSnippetModalFixer.user.js)&#8202;)

When opening a snippet, if you click too quickly before the snippet modal has been populated, SE's JS will throw an error due to a bug, preventing you from exiting the snippet and returning to the post. See [here](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/372944) for details. This userscript fixes the bug.
